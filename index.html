        <p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Known as a 'consulting detective', Holmes is known for a proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.            </p>
    
    <p>
            Amongst other foibles, Holmes had a penchant for papier maché and playing the violin.

    </p>

<p>Dr John H. Watson is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

        </div>herlock Holmes lives in 221B Baker Street, a London address, created by the writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

        <p>At the time the Holmes stories were published, addresses in Baker Street did not go as high as 221. In fact, number 85 was the last number of the street in 1890.            </p>
    
    <p>Baker Street was later extended, and in 1932 the Abbey National Building Society moved into premises at 219–229 Baker Street. For many years, Abbey National employed a full-time secretary to answer mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes.        </p>
    
    <p>The description of the house can be found throughout the stories. In 'A Study in Scarlet' (1887), Conan Doyle writes:        </p>
    
<blockquote>
    "...a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting room, cheerfully funrished, and illuminated by two broad windows."

            </div>n 1990, a plaque signifying 221B Baker Street was installed at the Sherlock Holmes Museum, situated elsewhere on the same street at Abbey National , and there followed a 15-year dispute between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail addressed to Holmes.</p>

            <p>Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership of the address by the Sherlock Holmes Museum has not been challenged. The Sherlock Holmes Museum is situated within an 1815 townhouse very similar to the 221B described in the stories and is located between 237 and 241 Baker Street.</p>


<p>The museum displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum.

        </div>rofessor James Moriarty, the arch-enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is a mathematics professor turned the world's only 'consulting criminal'. His genius is equal to, if not perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.</p>

<p>Moriarty is a genius, a philosopher and an abstract thinker, with a brain of the first order. As Holmes puts it: "He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them."</p>

<p>The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories.    </p>
    
<p>Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the 'Napoleon of crime'. Conan Doyle borrowed this phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind, who is one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.</p>

rene Adler, is a brilliant dominatrix with a genius evil mind. Creative and aware of how to use her sex and high emotional intelligence to make her own way in a male dominated world.</p>

<p>She is known as ‘The Woman’ in the novels because to Holmes — described as a "chivalrous" misogynist in the novels — she transcended and "eclipsed" the rest of her sex. Sherlock admires Adler for her wit and cunning and they have a requited romantic attraction.</p>

<p>She likes to 'misbehave' and gathers all sorts of incriminating information so as to continue to 'misbehave'.</p>

<p>She doesn’t show emotion however her ability to use emotion and sex to get her way shows a high level of intelligence; emotional and otherwise.</p>

<p>She is often underestimated by the other characters in the novels, mostly due to the era they live in and their obvious misogny. Her character is often misjudged by the characters of the book and modern creators in their Sherlock recreations.    </p>

<p>It is possible that Adler was based upon Lillie Langtry, the lover of Edward, the Prince of Wales. It was well known that Langtry was born in Jersey (she was called the "Jersey Lily") and Adler is born in New Jersey.</p>
